Hunt down social media accounts by username across [social networks](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/blob/master/sites.md)

## Usage

You can use Sherlock to find whether a certain username is available on most popular social networks, or you can stalk your friends accounts to see whether they have a profile on PornHub. Your choice.

Simply add the usernames you want to check in the input form and wait for the results to come. 

## Contributing
We would love to have you help us with the development of Sherlock. Each and every contribution is greatly valued!

Here are some things we would appreciate your help on:
- Addition of new site support ¹
- Bringing back site support of [sites that have been removed](removed_sites.md) in the past due to false positives


[1] Please look at the Wiki entry on [adding new sites](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/wiki/Adding-Sites-To-Sherlock)
to understand the issues.
